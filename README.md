# SQLProject-Solving the Murder Mystery

In this project, I used SQL to solve an hypothetical murder mystery whcih took place in SQL City

A crime has taken place, and the detective needs help. 

The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 

You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on January 15, 2018, and that it took place in SQL City. 

Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.
